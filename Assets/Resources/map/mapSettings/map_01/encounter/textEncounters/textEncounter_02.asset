  textPrompt: You stand on the precipice, your heart pounding as the ground trembles
    beneath your feet. Before you, a towering volcano spews molten fury into the
    heavens, its fiery maw a gateway to another world. The air crackles with magic,
    and ancient runes etched into obsidian stones hum with power. This is a place
    where dragons soar and wizards seek untold secrets, where the very earth dances
    with flames and whispers of long-lost treasures await brave souls like you.

    successPrompt: You manouver around the fiery pit, finding lotsa money $$$ !
